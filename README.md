Simple Material is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)-powered theme with a simple design following Google's Material Design guidelines. It's actually a fork of [reverie](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie) with some additional features and personal touches which I've implemented to suit my needs for my blog.

This is a plug-and-play Jekyll theme best suited to use on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) without even setting up a local environment.
